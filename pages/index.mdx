# Introduction

Hi! Glad to see you in my Math-5b class for Spring 2022. This is a website I cobbled together to make it easier to get by in this class. I 
intend on putting a bunch of different things on here: my own original explainers, exercises with solutions, study guides, animations, and suggestions for where else to look
in case you want more.

You'll find that there's a `dark-mode` and `light-mode` switch at the top right. 

## About me

My name is Shelwin Sunga. I'm an Applied Math and Computer Science student. I've been tutoring here for a semester, and I took Math-6 with Mr. Dorn in the Fall of 2020. 
I graduated high school in June of 2021. I'm not going to spill my life story - who cares about all that - but I will tell you I believe in ya. I've failed classes, I've 
drowned in coursework - I get it, school is hard. But I'm here to try and make this class as smooth as possible.
