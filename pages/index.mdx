# Introduction

Hi! Glad to see you in my Math-5b class for Spring 2022. This is a website I cobbled together to make it easier to get by in this class. I 
intend on putting a bunch of different things on here: my own original explainers, exercises with solutions, study guides, animations, and suggestions for where else to look
in case you want more.

You'll find that there's a `dark-mode` and `light-mode` switch at the top right.
