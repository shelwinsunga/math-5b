# How to review

Hi, maybe it's been awhile since you've taken Calculus 1 and you've forgotten some stuff. 
Maybe you just need a refresher. This section is basically a crashcourse of exercises that you should be able to do to be 
fully prepared for chapter 6. It's not super detailed or nuanced - it's mostly about whether or not you remember certain rules
concepts. 

## You don't need to do all the exercises

The exercises are not homework. They are there for you to gauge your own understanding. If you don't remember exactly how to do the power rule, then it might be 
worth trying a few exercises. The exercises do get progressively harder or at least more complicated, so if you feel really comfortable, you can test this by starting from the bottom of the exercise list.
