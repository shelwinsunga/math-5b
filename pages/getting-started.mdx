# Getting Started

## Installation

If you haven't already, install the Dart SDK
([tutorial](https://dart.dev/get-dart)). <br />
You will also need to have <LaTeX  /> installed.

Then, you can install the ManimWeb CLI with:

```bash
pub global activate manim_web
```

That's it, the Manim Web CLI is installed.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If a directory should be added to the `PATH`. You will need to do it.
</Callout>

## Creating the project

The CLI is available with the `manimweb` and the `manim_web` command. BR
Both commands do the same things, choose the one you prefer.

Create a project with the default template with:

```bash
manimweb init --directory {directory}
```

Replace `{directory}` with the name of the directory to create. BR
Make sure the directory is empty or doesn't exist.

Then go to the directory ( `cd {directory}` ).

## First scene with Manim Web

You can open the `src/example.dart` in your favorite text editor. BR
Visual Studio Code with the Dart extension works really well.

Copy and paste the code bellow.

```dart
import 'package:manim_web/manim.dart';

class ExampleScene extends Scene {
  @override
  FutureOr<void> preload() {
    Tex.preload('Hello World!');
  }

  @override
  FutureOr<void> construct() async {
    var tex = Tex('Hello World!');

    tex.scaleUniformly(4);

    await play(FadeIn(tex));
  }
}
```

You can then start the dev server with:

```bash
manimweb dev --file src/example.dart --html src/example.html
```

The server should be running on
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/example.html)

## How it works

```dart highlight=1
import 'package:manim_web/manim.dart';

...
```

On line 1, you import the whole Manim Web library. It allows you to use `Scene`,
`Tex`, `FadeIn`.

```dart highlight=3,5,10
import 'package:manim_web/manim.dart';

class ExampleScene extends Scene {
  @override
  FutureOr<void> preload() {
    Tex.preload('Hello World!');
  }

  @override
  FutureOr<void> construct() async {
    var tex = Tex('Hello World!');

    tex.scaleUniformly(4);

    await play(FadeIn(tex));
  }
}
```

On line 3, you create a scene: `ExampleScene`.

Then, you define two methods: `preload` and `construct` on line 5 and 10.BR
Both methods return a `FutureOr<void>` which is either a `Future` (asynchronous
result) or of type `void`. The `construct` method is also `async`, it allows you
to use the `await` keyword later.

### The `construct` method

First, look at the `construct` method's body:

```dart highlight=1
var tex = Tex('Hello World!');

tex.scaleUniformly(4);

await play(FadeIn(tex));
```

You first create some text "Hello World!".

<Callout>
  It's called `Tex` because it's the text generated with <LaTeX />.<br />
  There is also `MathTex` which is the math formula generated with <LaTeX />.
</Callout>

```dart highlight=3
var tex = Tex('Hello World!');

tex.scaleUniformly(4);

await play(FadeIn(tex));
```

Then, the `tex` is scaled by 4 uniformly.

<Callout>
  You can also scale differently along the x and y axis with the `scale` method.
</Callout>

```dart highlight=5
var tex = Tex('Hello World!');

tex.scaleUniformly(4);

await play(FadeIn(tex));
```

Finally, the animation part:

You start by creating a new `Animation`. It's a `FadeIn` animation.

<Callout>There are a lot more: `FadeOut`, `ShowCreation`...</Callout>

Then, you play the animation with the `play` method.BR
The `play` method is part of the `Scene`, so you could also write:

```dart
await this.play(FadeIn(tex));
```

With the `this` keyword referring to the scene.

Also, you use `await` to wait for the scene to play the animation.

Now, you should know how the `construct` method works.

### The `preload` method

When running your animation, your browser can't use <LaTeX /> to generate the
needed Math formulas and texts. You need to preload the results.

The `preload` method is used for that, it doesn't run in your browser but
`manimweb` runs it. It tells which text and formulas need to be preloaded.

In this method, there is only one line:

```dart
Tex.preload('Hello World!');
```

You tell ManimWeb you will use Tex with the "Hello World!" text. Then, BR
ManimWeb will run <LaTeX /> to generate the "Hello World!" text.

## Mobjects

In ManimWeb, every element displayed is a `Mobject`.

`Tex` is a `Mobject`, but it's not the only one. There are many more mobjects:
MathTex, Circle, Square, Axes, Arrow, Dot, Group, NumberPlane, SVGMobject...

But, `Mobject` can't be rendered, they're only used as a container. `VMobject`
is an extension of `Mobject` which can be rendered. It's what most mobjects use.

## Animations

When using the `play` method, you used the `FadeIn` animation. BR
Every animation extends from `Animation`.

You can play many animations at once with the `playMany` method. Instead of
giving a single animation, you use a list of animations. Then, all the
animations will be played simultaneously.

If you want to delay the animations, you can use an `AnimationGroup` with the
`lagRatio` argument.
Like this:

```dart highlight=7-15
var square1 = Square();
var square2 = Square();

square1.shift(RIGHT);
square2.shift(RIGHT);

await play(
  AnimationGroup(
    [
      FadeIn(square1),
      FadeIn(square2),
    ],
    lagRatio: 0.02,
  ),
);
```
